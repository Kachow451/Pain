The karkinos themselves have conflicting legends, owing to their nomadic lifestyle resulting in many cultural groups emerging, each attesting to their own lore.","Regardless of their origins, most karkinos, especially those who hold to traditional beliefs, live a life of idyllic pastoralism. Herding flocks of giant crustaceans, schools of fish, and other placid oceanic life, karkinos families spend their days gazing into the endless depths and ruminating on the nature of the sea. Some karkinos are poets, whose musings are spread far and wide through underwater society, sung and rewritten as ballads and plays. Others isolate themselves far away from civilization with nothing more than their family or flocks for company. Living lives of quiet contemplation, they meditate on ancient truths only known to the long-lived and mysterious karkinos.","Typically dwelling at the seafloor, the existence of the karkinos is something known only to daring ocean adventurers, though legends about these mysterious crustacean people do spring up from time to time amid sailors and fishermen. Tritons, merfolk, and other intelligent civilizations of the sea may interact with the karkinos more frequently, though even then the karkinos' nomadic and secluded lifestyle makes these interactions relatively rare and spontaneous."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Ocean Guardians","entries":["Despite their peaceful and quiet ways, the karkinos are known too for great heroism in times of need.

Some karkinos go above and beyond, and utilize their prodigious natural strength and defenses to protect those who have need of it. These karkinos are often those who depart from their families to seek adventure, striking an impressive silhouette among groups of aquatic adventurers.","Even besides these heroic individuals, the karkinos have a long rivalry with malicious creatures of the deep. Sahuagin who terrorize other races, krakens fouling the waters, and other beasts of the deep are all ancestral enemies of the karkinos, and they require little persuasion to mobilize against such threats.

If you've read the {@i Campaign Guide}, you know what Grim Hollow is all about. ıf you haven't lock your doors and draw your shutters. Gather 'round the campfire, but keep na eye on the underbush. It's full moon tonight!","Dark fantasy and horror have long been a favorite genre of storytellers—not to mention story listeners. From the earliest humans gathered around fires, making up stories of the monsters that inhabited the dark, the wilderness, the seas, and the spaces between the stars, we've never lost the thrill of being thrilled, the adrenaline rush of being scared out of our wits, while knowing—or at least hoping—that we're safe from any true danger.","Grim Hollow and its world of Etharis offer roleplaying game fans the ability to partake in those thrills of a dark fantasy setting. Whether the terror comes in the form of nature's most reddened teeth and claws, or the fear spread through mortals' actions when they're driven by the lust for power, or the horror of lifeless monsters shambling through the moonless nights longing to extinguish the bright lights of life, Etharis teems with threats perfect for many different styles of horror-based, dark-fantasy campaigns.","More importantly, the rules in this book provide the means to allow players to experiment with their characters, who face the most terrible fate of all: succumbing to the darkness and being changed by it. The existential terror of becoming a monster can make fighting monsters seem pale by comparison.","We thank the 9,138 backers who supported us in creating {@i Grim Hollow: The Players Guide}. Your overwhelming trust gave us the means and the motivation to make this book everything it could be. We hope you find in this book, whether you're a player or a GM, the ideas and the rules to create a campaign that captures deeply the feel of people staring into the darkness, hoping to survive but dreading what might come out of it—or out of themselves.",{"type":"section","name":"Playing a Dark Fantasy Campaign","page":4,"entries":["Classic tabletop roleplaying games often see the adventurers striding boldly across the countryside, tracking evil to its lair and vanquishing it in the name of wealth and glory, protecting the world and its people for another day.","Dark fantasy tells a different story, and the world of Grim Hollow invites participants to imagine narratives tinged with shadow, fear, and the drama of despair.","In the world of Etharis, the roles are reversed from a typical high-fantasy campaign. It is the good who cower in their fragile bastions of civilization while evil stalks freely across the land. Adventurers skulk furtively through the shadows, always aware of the danger that follows closely behind them—or the danger lurking within their bodies and souls. Welcome to Grim Hollow!",{"type":"entries","name":"The World is Lost","page":5,"entries":["Etharis is a world on the brink of total destruction. The gods are dead, coldfire threatens to consume the world, the City Below stands poised to flood the world with unearthly dangers... any one of a hundred events could be the spark that sets the world aflame.","In such a world, how can heroes exist? What does victory even look like? Players in such a setting should take these factors into consideration when tackling character creation and during gameplay itself.","Character backstories in fantasy rarely revolve around happy and mundane events. In dark fantasy, those backstories are generally even more dark and dramatic.","What motivates and shapes dark fantasy protagonists? The loss of a loved one. Betrayal by those closest to them. Disastrous events that the character felt powerless to stop. Inscrutable and irrepressible powers reaching out and molding the lives and personalities of the characters with a cold and malevolent disregard.","The world of Etharis is defined by these horrible events, and it stands to reason that the characters within it follow suit. How would these circumstances and events lead to a life as an adventurer, braving the dangers that most flee from in terror? Did your character become bitter and cynical, only looking out for their own interests? Did they rally and push back against despair, resolving to fight for the last glimmers of light that remain? What is your character fighting for?","These themes also work their way into the game itself. With the world in ruins, various elements of normal roleplaying get turned on their heads. Safety becomes a relative term, so spells such as {@spell alarm} or {@spell arcane lock} might be more useful than in traditional high fantasy settings. The monsters that stalk the wilds have successfully taken down entire civilizations, making it important to carefully pick your battles. Maybe not every battle or encounter is worth the cost of risking the entire war against darkness."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Darkness is a Choice","page":5,"entries":["Demons walk the land of Etharis, twisting mortal fates to their whim. Misshapen abominations skulk in the shadows, waiting for their opportunity to strike. Darkness seeps from every corner and every crack in the world's façade, whispering promises of great power to those willing to answer... and to sacrifice. One enduring truth defines the tenebrous forces at play in Etharis: there is always a price for the aid of dark powers.","Part of making a character in Grim Hollow is acknowledging the power of the forces of darkness. This setting offers a number of options for incorporating those powers into your character. Rather than merely picking up a Transformation Boon or the use of sangromancy like you would with an additional skill proficiency, these options work best when tied to specific character events. Perhaps you gladly accept these powers as a means to exact the revenge that your character seeks, or maybe it was an unwilling accident on the night of a full moon. Does your character regret these events or choices? Or do they fully embrace the power they have gained?","Once taken, these abilities are notoriously difficult to handle. When dealing with other humanoids, revealing your true nature can cause serious problems. As your power grows, its nature becomes harder and harder to conceal and control, and therefore harder to avoid the ramifications of your choice. It might be worth investing in {@item disguise kit|phb} proficiency or abilities such as {@spell disguise self} in order to better blend in among normal people.","Alas, even that might not be sufficient if circumstances force you to use your powers around others. Be warned. When you become as feared as the dark forces you oppose, natural agencies, like the business end of a farmer's pitchfork, can be just as dangerous as supernatural ones."]},{"type":"entries","name":"The Gods are Dead","page":5,"entries":["Quite possibly the greatest cataclysm to strike Etharis was the disappearance of the gods. Few people know the truth of their downfall, with the exception of the human pantheon, but all are aware that praying to the gods brings no aid and no relief. The divine magic that always offered healing and protection to those in need vanished, and now few remain who can remember that golden age.","As a player, the extreme scarcity of divine magic offers certain challenges to those wishing to play a cleric or paladin. Your very existence is a notable event, and you should discuss with your GM how you retain your magic and what effect that is likely to have on the world as a whole. The requirements for multiclassing are even steeper, and should be worked into the story as a major plot point.","The death of the gods has serious consequences, even for those who don't wish to partake in a divine class. Clerics, paladins, and religious organizations in general are often the main source of healing and curative magic in a roleplaying game, so their absence offers a major challenge. Diseases, curses, and other conditions are far more serious when you can't just stroll into the nearest temple and donate a hefty gold fee to cure them.","Similarly, resurrection is a near impossibility. Players should be aware that lives are all the more precious in Etharis. Even the more mundane services offered by clergy, such as giving blessings and selling holy water, are rare. The helpful items for fighting the legions of darkness are valued greatly, and their value becomes even greater, meaning they should be seen and used sparingly."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Magic is Mistrusted","page":5,"entries":["With the disappearance of divine magic, arcane spellcasters on Etharis found themselves the target of hatred and mistrust. A magic inquisition started in the Castinellan Provinces, bureaucracies sprang up to regulate and control mages elsewhere, and mobs hunted down those the common folk blamed for the gods' absence. Where once they delved into the mysteries of the universe, now wizards and their kin must seek to ensure their very survival.","As a player making an arcane spellcaster, whether a wizard, sorcerer, or warlock, you face a superstitious and hostile populace. Many of the regions in Etharis have instituted licensing schemes in order to regulate magic, so a valid license is an important piece of equipment for those seeking to practice magic legitimately. Wizards are the primary licensed spellcasters, while warlocks are almost never part of a magical organization or academy. With their innate abilities, sorcerers fall between the two, with as many fugitives as licensed practitioners.","Decide which category your character falls in, and work with your GM to determine any restrictions that may apply to your spellcasting license. Even licensed spellcasters are not wholly exempt from the resentment of the common folk, so brandishing a wand and spellbook in the middle of a crowded tavern may not be the wisest decision.","If you're not playing a spellcaster, you should consider how you feel about magic as a character. Did you grow up in the Castinellan Provinces, under the stern gaze of the Watchers of the Faithful? Or were you from the Nordlands, where magic is as much a fabric of everyday life as the forests and rivers? Regardless of how you feel about arcane magic at the start of your adventuring career, you should also consider how that opinion changes over time. Was your mistrust of arcane magic foolish as you now see it wielded by good and noble casters? Or do your personal interactions with arcane casters teach you that the fear of the arcane that you wrote off as superstition was instead a wise and prudent choice?"]},{"type":"entries","name":"Travel is Dangerous","page":6,"entries":["Adventurers in roleplaying games are travelers. It's an integral part of the job and of the game as a whole. Normally travel occurs along a well-maintained and patrolled system of roads, with occasional forays into the natural wilderness in search of some vile creature upsetting the normal order of the world.","In a dark fantasy setting, messengers and patrols cannot be relied upon, and anyone who goes outside the safety of the town walls takes their life in their hands. Nighttime is especially dangerous, for any light serves as a beacon to the creatures waiting in the inky darkness. Travel in Etharis is not for the faint of heart, and may prove challenges equal to any story's climax.","As a character braving the wilds of Etharis, the first thing to learn is that there is no such thing as a safe campsite. When night falls, everything becomes fair game, so it's best to be prepared. Setting watches alone may not be sufficient, and you should always have a plan for awakening your allies to deal with the inevitable complications. Spells can aid in this regard, whether it's {@spell alarm}, {@spell magic mouth}, or any of the various sonic spells that can be heard hundreds of feet away. Darkvision can be especially useful for those standing watch, to avoid advertising your presence with a torch or campfire. But even then, darkvision is not perfect, and its limits can give certain threats an upper hand. Warding and protection spells, such as {@spell leomund's tiny hut|PHB|tiny hut} or {@spell rope trick}, are valuable in surviving long treks across dangerous territory.","One additional consequence of the state of social isolation in Etharis: information travels very slowly. With no reliable messengers and limited magic, adventurers are sometimes the main source of communication between settlements. This can lead to problems, but can also work to the characters' advantage if they don't want news of their exploits spread."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Humanity is Cruel","page":6,"entries":["When faced with difficult circumstances, there are those who rise to the occasion and act out of charitable intentions and seek to help those in need. In a dark fantasy setting, most people fall on the other side of the coin. Etharis is populated mainly by those who look out for themselves, often to the detriment of others. Whether it's scheming nobles living in the lap of luxury on the hard work of others or superstitious townsfolk doing whatever is necessary to keep from drowning in the terrible ocean of poverty, the people of Etharis are always looking at what they get out of any agreement. In this world, xenophobia, paranoia, and plain cruelty are the order of the day.","Dealing with NPCs is a cornerstone of roleplaying, but the aforementioned conditions make it an especially dicey proposition in Etharis. Help is not something given freely by the strangers you meet in the world. Even an easy smile and a honeyed tongue have their limits, so be prepared to deal with people on less charitable terms.","Bribery, intimidation, coercion, and sometimes outright blackmail are more common than appeals for mercy or sympathy. Knowing what the other person wants is a valuable piece of information when trying to come to some sort of arrangement, so wisdom is just as important as charisma. Spells such as charm person may seem like an easy answer, but the fear and hatred of magic in Etharis are amplified when used to usurp a person's will. And those spells do wear off.","This mistrust and paranoia in Etharis make some abilities, afterthoughts in other types of campaigns or settings, extremely valuable. Boons provided by your background abilities, for example, may save your life as much as a quick weapon or a fireball. Being able to rely on friends for a meal and a safe shelter can be some of your most powerful tools when dealing with other people, especially in a low-charisma party. The ability to find at least one friendly face in a new town may be the difference between life and death."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Legends are Not Born","page":6,"entries":["Despite the many abilities, magical items, and other advantages an adventurer has over the common citizen of Etharis, characters still face an uphill battle. The threats arrayed against them are legion, and many are strong enough to rip the very fabric of reality asunder. As a result, characters must be aware that they are not at the top of the food chain. The danger is very real, and death is a constant possibility. Those who rise to great heights do so only after a long and difficult struggle — and the fall from those heights is all the more dangerous.","What this means in game terms is that the player characters are relatively weaker than in traditional fantasy roleplaying campaigns. Progression to higher levels often requires greater effort and greater sacrifice than some players are used to. This is an element of dark fantasy and reflects the theme of constant danger. When building a character, it's wise not to take progression for granted and focus more on immediate viability. A character that will only come into its own after it gains four levels to pick up that one spell or feat you need is a character that will likely not survive through four levels.","Long-term planning is definitely an option, however. Many of the options presented in this book are designed with continual progression in mind. The key is not to rest all your hopes on the assumption of future levels. With danger all around, the future becomes a very uncertain prospect, and it's often more helpful to focus on surviving the present."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Victories are Earned","page":7,"entries":["A knight stands, chest heaving, amid the remains of an undead legion. Around her are bodies not just of the creatures she fought, but also her fallen comrades. She stands perfectly still, though she feels the wound in her side beginning to fester. Behind her the villagers begin to peek out from their hovels to see that disaster has been narrowly averted.","These are the types of victories to be found in Etharis. Hard-fought battles, won at a steep price, but worth the cost nonetheless. Success is not guaranteed. Victories have very real costs, and in some cases those costs are the very morals and ideals of the \"heroes\" who pay them.","A dark fantasy setting is one in which good does not always vanquish evil, and the players are not always the heroes. There is no great final battle between the forces of light and darkness, the victories that occur are temporary and fleeting. They are battles rather than wars. But they are still victories.","Being a player in Etharis is to be a character willing to sacrifice for their goals, and who realizes that each victory is still cause for celebration. Deciding your character's motivations and goals in this world often means narrowing your focus. There is little glory to be found, so personal stakes are more appropriate. Whether it be to heal your sick sibling or to finish the work of your departed mentor, Etharis lends itself to these shortterm, attainable goals. The grand adventures against impossible odds to save the world from the evils that surround it... those are stories for a later time."]},{"type":"entries","name":"There is Lİght Within the Darkness","page":7,"entries":["Despite the dire circumstances facing the world, hope still remains. It may be scattered, dimmed, assaulted on all sides, but it has not been extinguished. A farmer stands against the oncoming soldiers, giving his friends and family time to flee. A merchant, with a kindly smile, hands a loaf of bread to a poor beggar. A paladin, the last of his order, continues his quest to rid the world of a demon-prince. Across Etharis, small acts of kindness, of bravery, of charity, all stand out amid the dark backdrop. Few and far between, their scarcity only serves to make them more special.","Players should also realize that the characters they meet do not expect any sort of charity or kindness by their characters. Such acts are usually met with suspicion, and the players must be prepared to act accordingly. One might challenge the NPCs' expectations, seeking to sway them to your cause. Alternatively, a player's character might disguise their charity in order to avoid any conflict that might complicate the matter, such as slipping extra coin into a delivery so that it seems accidental."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Actions Matter","page":7,"entries":["These suggestions are intended to help guide players through the dark fantasy world of Etharis, but they remain merely that: suggestions. Your actions are ultimately yours to decide. As you make these choices and face challenges throughout your journey, know that each path you take will have consequences, for good or ill. How you face the situations presented will define your character and the story surrounding them. People can change based on their experiences, and a player should take into consideration everything their character has done in deciding how they will react to things in the future. Some extreme events may shift alignment, change motivations and goals, or alter a character's bonds, ideals, and flaws in surprising ways. Accepting the direction your character takes, even if it isn't one that you had planned on, often results in a more rewarding experience.","Your decisions will also shape your version of Etharis. Characters you meet may show up later to influence important moments in the story. Word of your deeds spreads, albeit slowly, between settlements. GMs may set the overarching plot for a campaign, but your actions provide the building blocks they use in the future. In this way, the characters and the world around them reinforce one another to form a complete, cohesive narrative. Etharis is, above all else, a world of difficult choices and serious consequences.

Nothing appears amiss, but weeks later the glamour fades and the true horror is revealed: the child has been stolen by the faerie, and a wechselkind is left in its place. The faerie are callous and unchanging beings, so nothing sparks their fascination (and their envy) more than the malleable, bright spark of a young human child.","A wechselkind is a construct crafted of wood, clay, and ceramic in the form of a small child, animated by faerie magic and concealed in a glamour that makes them appear identical to a stolen mortal babe. Once the glamour fades and the lie is revealed, the wechselkind is often cast out by its foster family, if not destroyed.","Occasionally, though, a family takes pity on the poor creature and attempts to raise it as they would a child, only to find that while their mind develops normally, a wechselkind is forever bound in the unchanging form of a childlike doll.","Whether nurtured or shunned, the wechselkind eventually finds itself an outcast in the world and must fend for itself as best it can. With few physical needs, the wechselkind often wanders from place to place, watching the people it encounters with envious eyes, hoping for a place to finally fit in.","The residual magic of its faerie glamour allows it to conceal itself in the guise of a human child, and a lone wechselkind often takes to begging by the side of the road or doing odd jobs around an isolated farmhouse, searching for some scraps of acceptance or a small trinket or two to take with it when it must inevitably move on.","Recently, with the advent of the Weeping Pox, the wechselkind have started to emerge from hiding and be recognized as a separate race of creatures.

An ancient race, the laneshi straddle the line between life and death, communing with spirits for guidance and unafraid to meet death on the battlefield. Pale humanoids with manes of kelp-like hair, they seek the underlying duality of everything they encounter. A laneshi is more likely than not to view matters in absolutes and react accordingly. Friend or foe. Day or night. Acceptance or rejection. All things must have their place, and to this end they have developed a rigid caste system.","The mystic caste comprises all those laneshi who are born as twins, a very common occurrence. When this happens, the first-born of the pair is inducted into the mystic caste, while the other twin is consecrated as his or her sibling's spirit guide. Using a powerful necromantic ritual, the second twin is sacrificed and its soul bound within the body of the other. Each member of the mystic caste is therefore possessed of two souls: one living and one dead. This grants them vision into the spirit world and heightens their necromantic abilities. Mystics are in charge of all things that possess no life, and are therefore in charge of funeral rites, crafting, construction, recordkeeping, and food preparation. Heavier duties are usually performed with the aid of undead labor.","The second caste, the warrior caste, is in charge of all things relating to the living. This includes not only warfare, but also ruling, diplomacy, farming, the raising and educating of children, and so forth. The warrior caste is roughly double the size of the mystic caste and is structured as a meritocracy, with great deeds leading to greater status. The laneshi are constantly at war with their deep-dwelling neighbors, and use their ability to speak with the marine wildlife to find opportunities for heroism and advancement.","Despite this, the rulers of the Llana'Shi Empire have recently turned their eyes toward the surface for unknown reasons. Perhaps some new and greater threat is stirring in the dark depths of the sea, and the Laneshi seek aid from their air-breathing cousins.

Regardless of the veracity of such tales, the ogresh still exist across the continent, viewed as something of an exotic oddity.","In truth, the scarcity of the ogresh is a result of their particular biology. Young ogresh mature slowly, and during their extended youth, which may last decades, they are driven by a deep-seated sense of wanderlust. This feeling compels them to travel in search of a suitable area to settle, consisting of ample natural resources, a local population of sentient creatures, and a lack of other ogresh nearby. Once they decide upon an area, an ogresh enters the second stage of their life, which is marked by a drastically increased appetite and a mostly sedentary lifestyle. More than a single ogresh could easily deplete the surplus of a small village, so the reason for their wanderlust is a simple case of biological necessity.","Given their reliance on other species, it comes as no surprise that the ogresh are masters of social interaction.

Many found themselves wholly bereft of their powers, cast down to Etharis to live out their nowmortal lives amidst the lesser races.","The downcast, as they have come to be called, are far fewer in number than when they first arrived, with a great number of them succumbing to despair and sickness after their fall from grace.

The name of this empire has been lost, and only fragmented remains of the oldest stories even hint at the grand heights that race once reached.","What can be gleaned from the histories of the elves and dwarves is that at one point a horrible calamity befell the land, wiping clean any trace of this ancient empire. The disaster came suddenly and without warning, and it was believed that nothing survived.

It burns bright blue while giving off no heat. It can \"burn\" on ice and snow. While it is slow to spread on ice and water, once it touches organic material, it rapidly and voraciously consumes plant and animal matter, turning them into ice. Coldfire then grows and spreads rapidly in a blue conflagration. It has been observed consuming flesh, leather, grass, wood, moss, and bones. There was once a forest north of Solheim; now it is just a garden of tree-shaped ice. Even mortal creatures immune to cold cannot escape the curse of coldfire. Their flesh merely slows down the coldfire, but they eventually also turn to ice.","Once it starts burning, coldfire is very difficult to stop. Intense heat is the only known countermeasure against it, such that the scouts of Fort Kentigern have employed burning oil and even fire spells in attempts to stop its spread.","Standing against the coldfire threat are the monks of the Order of St. Kentigern. Named after the First Hero who defeated the Great Wyrm, the Order's main function is to guard against the spread of coldfire. Their main strategy is to confine it at its source—Volgen, the island said to contain Gormadraug's heart.

The capital of Erlefurt has the highest number of magical colleges anywhere in the continent, with the Magister College being the oldest and most venerable of all.","It's difficult for an aspiring mage to enter an Erlefurt College, but the Magister College proves itself to be exceptionally stringent. The Magister chooses only the best among its applicants—not merely those with high magical aptitude, but also those most likely to bring greater honour to the school.","The Erlefurt Colleges see magic as a force that must be harnessed with wisdom, the kind that only those trained in the way of the Erlefurt mages possess. As such, all students must swear to follow a set of rigid laws, listed in a tome called the Magician's Codex.","The primary laws in the Codex include the following:","Only wizards that pass their final tests of the Erlefurt Colleges may carry the title of Erlefurt mage.","An Erlefurt mage shall defend their College against all who would despoil them or steal their secrets.","Only the Erlefurt Colleges may train a student. All students must be registered and approved by the Colleges.","All magical experiments must be registered and approved by the Colleges.","Any Erlefurt wizard who breaks this code of laws is hunted down by the Enforcers, a group elite abjurers highly adept at subduing one of their own. Once captured, they are taken to the magician's court and judged by the Grand Mage. If found guilty, transgressors may be magically imprisoned or even executed. As for other arcane institutions who don't subscribe to these tenets, they are treated with contempt and even outright hostility.","As there are no established magical colleges in the Grarjord, the Valikan Clans send promising students to Erlefurt for tutelage."]},{"type":"entries","name":"Ravencourt Sanctuary","page":31,"entries":["East of Raevo's shores, hidden among the mists of its enchanted isle, the Ravencourt Sanctuary trains its mages in its own academy.","Unlike its rival, the Magister College, the Sanctuary believes that magic may only grow through freedom. Thus the Ravencourt Sanctuary has few laws to guide the actions of its mages. Their primary rule is that the mages must keep all the secrets of the Sanctuary safe. Apart from that, a wizard who successfully graduates from the Sanctuary is free to do what they will and teach whom they want.","Despite their seeming lack of laws, the punishment for breaking the primary rule is both harsh and unequivocal. Before they leave the Sanctuary, a Ravencourt wizard swears a vow to protect their academy's secrets. They write their name on a page of an enchanted book and leave a drop of their blood on it. This creates a highly potent curse: if they should break the vow, the page tears itself from the book and burns.

By watching and listening to the natural world, the elves first learned to summon and shape numen. Thus they teach their students to pay close attention to detail and focus on what they can sense. The emphasis on patience makes teaching slow. Often, education at Sarmar can last decades. For elves, of course, that's a short period of time.","Being an entirely elven city, only elves may enroll in Sarmar Academy proper.

This program was begun decades ago by an elven mage named Alren Corynthios as an experiment in teaching the elven way of magic to non-elves.

In the Bürach Empire, for instance, it was considered a means to maintain order, project power, instill obedience, gather information, and maintain the status quo.","However, with the coming of the Great Beast, magic is now treated with greater suspicion, as some have come to suspect that the entity was the result of an arcane experiment gone horribly wrong. The Hearthkeepers have not denied this notion, as it deflects their own culpability on the matter.","The Ostoyan view of magic is more varied. In the province of Soma, the lower classes fear magic as something they're incapable of understanding. They also stay clear of it to avoid inciting the jealousy and ire of the nobility. The Crimson Court believes that the use of magic is theirs by right; anyone else who uses it must either become their servant or be destroyed as a potential threat. Thus one often finds mages under their employ in their war against Raevo and the Bürach Empire.","In the province of Raevo, magic is by and large an accepted part of daily life. The workshops and markets of Castalore are teeming with wizards and magical constructs, all under the watchful eye of the Ravencroft Sanctuary.","In the Charneault Kingdom, the elves treat magic as an integral part of their lives. They hold skilled mages in high esteem, even as they warn of the costs of seeking greater magical power.","The dark elves have no such restraint; they plumb the deepest secrets of magecraft with hardly a thought to the dangers involved. While they have attained great power, the price is often paid by the entirety of the kingdom, as is the case with the Dark Mist.","In the human-controlled lands of the Charneault, attitudes vary greatly. Mages are treated with respect in more learned circles, but among Knight Chapters they are treated with suspicion, and in the case of the Severe Templars, outright hostility. They hold elven magic accountable for the suffering endured by the populace and forego all arcane abilities in favor of strength in arms and divine fervor.","It is worth noting the Castinellan Provinces in particular when it comes to magic for the specific chance they've chosen: deplorably, the theocracy is hostile to all forms of arcane magic. It is the will of Empyreus, they claim, that their people wage a righteous war against all magic-users and those who harbor them. To undertake this task, the Arcanist Inquisition has assembled a host of knights and common soldiers under the command of clerics and paladins. Backed by the power of belief, they call on divine magic to locate arcane mages and neutralise them.","As such, magic-users must all be careful when entering the Castinellan Provinces, lest they be arrested, imprisoned, and very likely put to death by the Arcanist Inquisition. Mages cannot even expect sympathy from the common folk; most peasants hold all magic as witchcraft and devilry, the power of demons brought to Etharis.","The Castinellans have yet to move against nations that employ magic, such as the Bürach and the Charneault Kingdom.

They opened their eyes to behold a universe of wonder and chaos, and they were enamored by it. They wanted to shape it into something that resembled them. But to do that, they needed to impose order.","The gods, good and evil alike, banded together to form a pantheon. They shaped the firmament and the seas, then the land and all the creatures that followed. They named the land Etharis and created the races to populate it.","As these newborn mortals turned their minds to their creators, the gods found an endless font of believers. Their worship lifted the gods to greater heights, securing their ability to turn the wheel of the universe.","But the gods were not alone. At the fringes of their ordered realm lurked the Aether Kindred—incomprehensible beings of pure chaos who predated the gods themselves. The Kindred were mostly content to remain uninvolved, thought occasionally the gods would find a piece of reality in disarray—a star gone missing, an ocean dried up, an entire city disappearing into the void.","When the entire race of the Sommerkin vanished one day, the gods decided they'd had enough. The Aether Kindred were an active threat to their power. The gods feared that one day all they had built would be stripped away. They need to strike now, while they still had the faith of their followers and stood at the height of their powers.","Thus, all the gods, good and evil alike, banded together as a host and launched an assault on the Kindred. This became known as the Aetheric War.","None can say precisely what happened to the gods who participated in the war. Some historians say it was a slaughter. Others believe the gods were consumed by the eldritch horrors they tried to defeat. Others state that some gods retreated from this plane to someplace the Kindred could not reach them. While nothing is certain about what happened to the gods thereafter, it is quite certain they were utterly defeated.","Of the great pantheon, only the four youngest survived: Galt the Builder, Maligant Warclad, Ulmyr the Wise, and Aurelia of the Hearth. Perhaps out of caution or fear, they held back from the Aetheric War. Thus, they were the only ones left to pick up the pieces, becoming responsible for the fostering of Etharis's future.","If there was any silver lining to the Aetheric War, it was that the Kindred never showed themselves afterward. It's believed these horrors slept deeply after destroying so many of the gods, perhaps requiring rest to heal from their wounds. But once they have regenerated, they will likely take revenge on the rest of the gods' creations.","Whatever the reason, this left the Four Divines to their own devices. As the surviving gods left to guide the mortals of Etharis, they decided to band together. Their idea was to create an ideal empire, the \"one above all\" to act as a shining beacon for all mortals to emulate. This idea became the Bürach Empire. Its first emperor, Indorius I, would be the lightbringer for all the nations of Etharis. To this end, the Four Divines gifted him with four holy artifacts that would enable him to rule wisely and protect his empire.","For a time, all was good. Unfortunately, this method of salvation carried the seeds of its own destruction. The Bürach Empire so loved their emperor that they decided to keep his bloodline eternally pure. The Church of the Hearthkeepers imposed the Edict of Eternal Blood, mandating that only those of the line of Indorius I may ascend to the throne. With that, they forced his descendants to intermarry, weakening their blood. The wretched outcome of this practice finally manifested in the Mad Emperor, Leopold.","When Leopold touched the divine artifacts, his mind and soul were instantly connected with the Four Divines—and it drove them all to madness. Galt, Malignant, Ulmyr, and Aurelia warred among themselves, each vying to reign as the One True God of the universe. This culminated in the Gods' End, when these last remaining deities destroyed one another.","Etharis carries on as a godless world.

These Primordials were Alondo of the Deep, Morrakesh the Burning Lady, Citrolach the Living Mountain, and Ilhara the Queen of Air and Shadow.","This time, Gormadraug aimed to win.

We strongly recommend groups expand upon and customize these rules to best fit the themes and playstyle of their game.","One way in which a group may do this is by relaxing the rules limiting Resolve and Beast Abilities to the party and GM, respectively. In certain circumstances it may make sense to allow party members to use abilities listed under the Beast Pool, such as when their actions align with the goals of the villain, and a GM may want to dip into the Resolve Abilities to boost the difficulty of an encounter.","Another method of customization is by altering the abilities themselves. The Outnumbered ability from the Beast Pool, for example, can easily be adapted to summoning spells and moved over to the Resolve Pool. Inner Strength can be used to boost the healing of a fighter's Second Wind ability or to increase the level of a {@spell cure wounds} spell. Summoning the Beast can easily be swapped out for an appearance by whatever villain the GM has set as the primary antagonist of the campaign. All of these are appropriate uses of Influence Dice.","Depending on the actions of the party and the GM, there may be a situation where a pool of dice fills completely and stays there for an extended period of time. One option to prevent this disparity is to allow a trade-off between the two. When a player would gain a Resolve Die, they may instead choose to decrease the Beast Pool by one. Similarly, when the GM would add a die to the Beast Pool, the increase in threat can be represented just as well by decreasing the Resolve Pool by one. This provides for a more fluid interplay between the two pools, acting almost like a tug-of-war on the weave of Fate's tapestry.","As a final note, one bit of warning regarding these rules: in general, pitting party members against one another is something to be avoided. If you want to include this as an option in your game, or if you contemplate using some of these rules to that effect, we strongly recommend discussing this with your group ahead of time to make sure that everyone agrees with the idea.

You can always re-up with the same characters if everyone wants to keep going.)","Session Zero is also where you should work out questions like who brings what snacks, and whether you share dice or everyone brings their own.

While playing in Grim Hollow, the players and the GM each have a pool of six-sided dice to draw upon in order to shift the fates in their favor. The players' dice are known as Resolve Dice, while the GM's pool consists of Beast Dice.","At the start of a campaign, each pool has a single {@dice d6}, but events during the game can add or remove dice from each pool. After each session, if one dice pool has at least two more dice than the other then the GM should add an extra {@dice d6} to the pool with fewer dice to represent Fate attempting to correct the imbalance.","The dice in each pool can be spent to activate a number of different abilities, representing the ways in which Fate has been altered for good or for ill.","During play, the number of dice in each pool is another factor for the players to consider when plotting their next course of action. For this reason, it is appropriate for the level of dice in the Beast Pool to be represented in-game, allowing the characters to react without metagaming and breaking immersion.","One way to accomplish this is by interactions with NPCs. News may reach the party of some supernatural phenomenon which has the locals on edge, or the party's local informant warns them of an increase in monster attacks. Other times the party's surroundings themselves change to represent the growing threat. Omens and portents foretell disaster, and the creatures the party encounters take on a more disturbing appearance.","By contrast, the Resolve Pool is best represented by the players themselves.

The GM can award dice to the party based on their actions or at specific plot moments within the game. If a player accurately and faithfully represents their character's bonds, flaws, and ideals in difficult circumstances, it's appropriate for the GM to award a Resolve Die based on their excellent roleplaying. Furthermore, certain actions may result in the reward of a Resolve Die if they represent events which would bolster the party's determination. Rare acts of self-sacrifice, kindness, or charity may act as a light in the darkness and help the party to forge ahead, as represented by the addition of a Resolve Die to the pool.","Once there are dice in the Resolve Pool, the party can then draw upon them to activate special abilities throughout the game.

We strongly recommend groups expand upon and customize these rules to best fit the themes and playstyle of their game.","One way in which a group may do this is by relaxing the rules limiting Resolve and Beast Abilities to the party and GM, respectively. In certain circumstances it may make sense to allow party members to use abilities listed under the Beast Pool, such as when their actions align with the goals of the villain, and a GM may want to dip into the Resolve Abilities to boost the difficulty of an encounter.","Another method of customization is by altering the abilities themselves. The Outnumbered ability from the Beast Pool, for example, can easily be adapted to summoning spells and moved over to the Resolve Pool. Inner Strength can be used to boost the healing of a fighter's Second Wind ability or to increase the level of a {@spell cure wounds} spell. Summoning the Beast can easily be swapped out for an appearance by whatever villain the GM has set as the primary antagonist of the campaign. All of these are appropriate uses of Influence Dice.","Depending on the actions of the party and the GM, there may be a situation where a pool of dice fills completely and stays there for an extended period of time. One option to prevent this disparity is to allow a trade-off between the two. When a player would gain a Resolve Die, they may instead choose to decrease the Beast Pool by one. Similarly, when the GM would add a die to the Beast Pool, the increase in threat can be represented just as well by decreasing the Resolve Pool by one. This provides for a more fluid interplay between the two pools, acting almost like a tug-of-war on the weave of Fate's tapestry.","As a final note, one bit of warning regarding these rules: in general, pitting party members against one another is something to be avoided. If you want to include this as an option in your game, or if you contemplate using some of these rules to that effect, we strongly recommend discussing this with your group ahead of time to make sure that everyone agrees with the idea. The most important thing is to have fun, and the rules should serve that goal, even if they have to be bent or broken at times."]}]}},{"0":{"name":"Fin Symbiote","source":"GHPG","page":133,"rarity":"rare","reqAttune":"by an aberrant horror","wondrous":true,"entries":["This tendril of flesh harvested from a living aboleth can be embedded into the skin of an aberrant horror.

Nothing appears amiss, but weeks later the glamour fades and the true horror is revealed: the child has been stolen by the faerie, and a wechselkind is left in its place. The faerie are callous and unchanging beings, so nothing sparks their fascination (and their envy) more than the malleable, bright spark of a young human child.","A wechselkind is a construct crafted of wood, clay, and ceramic in the form of a small child, animated by faerie magic and concealed in a glamour that makes them appear identical to a stolen mortal babe. Once the glamour fades and the lie is revealed, the wechselkind is often cast out by its foster family, if not destroyed.","Occasionally, though, a family takes pity on the poor creature and attempts to raise it as they would a child, only to find that while their mind develops normally, a wechselkind is forever bound in the unchanging form of a childlike doll.","Whether nurtured or shunned, the wechselkind eventually finds itself an outcast in the world and must fend for itself as best it can. With few physical needs, the wechselkind often wanders from place to place, watching the people it encounters with envious eyes, hoping for a place to finally fit in.","The residual magic of its faerie glamour allows it to conceal itself in the guise of a human child, and a lone wechselkind often takes to begging by the side of the road or doing odd jobs around an isolated farmhouse, searching for some scraps of acceptance or a small trinket or two to take with it when it must inevitably move on.","Recently, with the advent of the {@disease Weeping Pox|GH}, the wechselkind have started to emerge from hiding and be recognized as a separate race of creatures. With their immunity to disease, a number of wechselkind have offered their services as nurses and doctor's assistants in plague-stricken regions, gaining recognition and praise from those able to see beyond their tragic beginnings. These wechselkind are grateful for a sense of purpose and a place to belong, but remain wary. Once their usefulness is at an end, they know they may be cast out once more."]},"1":{"name":"Laneshi","source":"GHPG","entries":["Deep beneath the waves lies the Llana'Shi Empire. An ancient race, the laneshi straddle the line between life and death, communing with spirits for guidance and unafraid to meet death on the battlefield. Pale humanoids with manes of kelp-like hair, they seek the underlying duality of everything they encounter. A laneshi is more likely than not to view matters in absolutes and react accordingly. Friend or foe. Day or night. Acceptance or rejection. All things must have their place, and to this end they have developed a rigid caste system.","The mystic caste comprises all those laneshi who are born as twins, a very common occurrence. When this happens, the first-born of the pair is inducted into the mystic caste, while the other twin is consecrated as his or her sibling's spirit guide. Using a powerful necromantic ritual, the second twin is sacrificed and its soul bound within the body of the other. Each member of the mystic caste is therefore possessed of two souls: one living and one dead. This grants them vision into the spirit world and heightens their necromantic abilities. Mystics are in charge of all things that possess no life, and are therefore in charge of funeral rites, crafting, construction, recordkeeping, and food preparation. Heavier duties are usually performed with the aid of undead labor.","The second caste, the warrior caste, is in charge of all things relating to the living. This includes not only warfare, but also ruling, diplomacy, farming, the raising and educating of children, and so forth. The warrior caste is roughly double the size of the mystic caste and is structured as a meritocracy, with great deeds leading to greater status. The laneshi are constantly at war with their deep-dwelling neighbors, and use their ability to speak with the marine wildlife to find opportunities for heroism and advancement.","Despite this, the rulers of the Llana'Shi Empire have recently turned their eyes toward the surface for unknown reasons. Perhaps some new and greater threat is stirring in the dark depths of the sea, and the Laneshi seek aid from their air-breathing cousins. Or perhaps the rumors of mysterious visitors to the royal palace and blasphemous compacts with ancient evils are true, and the laneshi king is looking for new lands to conquer to appease the hunger of his unnamable master."]},"2":{"name":"Ogresh","source":"GHPG","entries":["The populous races of Etharis all have stories about the ogresh, although few have seen them in person. Stories describe them as solitary wise men and women who serve as founts of information and advice for the nearby communities. Adventure tales abound where the protagonist receives counsel from an ogresh before setting off on their quest, and yet others describe royal advisors with a distinctive set of wide features. Regardless of the veracity of such tales, the ogresh still exist across the continent, viewed as something of an exotic oddity.","In truth, the scarcity of the ogresh is a result of their particular biology. Young ogresh mature slowly, and during their extended youth, which may last decades, they are driven by a deep-seated sense of wanderlust. This feeling compels them to travel in search of a suitable area to settle, consisting of ample natural resources, a local population of sentient creatures, and a lack of other ogresh nearby. Once they decide upon an area, an ogresh enters the second stage of their life, which is marked by a drastically increased appetite and a mostly sedentary lifestyle. More than a single ogresh could easily deplete the surplus of a small village, so the reason for their wanderlust is a simple case of biological necessity.","Given their reliance on other species, it comes as no surprise that the ogresh are masters of social interaction. Each individual is born with an inherent ability to read body language and vocal cues helpful in discerning the attitude of others. Indeed, the vast stores of knowledge often attributed to the ogresh is a reflection of their uncanny ability to glean information about an individual through these subtle clues. Even a casual conversation could end up revealing far more than one would intend to these keen observers, and the ogresh are smart enough to capitalize on such information."]},"3":{"name":"The Downcast","source":"GHPG","entries":["With the end of the God-War, the Arch Seraphs of each deity descended upon the world, each taking upon their own shoulders the burden of imposing order on a world cast into disarray. These Arch Seraphs were the most powerful lieutenants among the angelic hosts, strong enough to retain a semblance of their power following the tragedy. The lesser angels were not so lucky. Many found themselves wholly bereft of their powers, cast down to Etharis to live out their nowmortal lives amidst the lesser races.","The downcast, as they have come to be called, are far fewer in number than when they first arrived, with a great number of them succumbing to despair and sickness after their fall from grace. Of those who remain, some still serve the Arch Seraphs in their twisted crusades, hoping to reclaim what they have lost. Others have turned their backs on their former comrades to seek their own goals, fully embracing mortal life. Lastly are those who feel embittered by their fall and have been gleefully accepted by the Arch Demons as agents to spread fear and destruction.","Physically, the downcast still possess the beauty of their angelic forms, although they no longer shine as brightly as before. The mark of the divine still remains as a visible glow within their eyes, and faint markings on their skin mimic Celestial runes.","There is also variation based on the deity that each served in the past. Those who follow Maligant are physically stronger, Galt's host are hardy and resilient, Ulmyr's are possessed of a keen intellect, and Aurelia's kin have softer features and soothing voices.","Over time, the downcast have learned to tap into the small shreds of divine power that lie sleeping within their blood. That power still remembers the downcast's former purpose and can be harnessed in times of great need to aid those who once called upon the gods for their power. This ability is as dangerous as it is powerful, for there are many who would seek to take it by force. Fallen clergy who seek to drain the downcast in order to restore their own failing powers, vampires seeking to drink from a fountain of the tainted divine, even those who treat with powerful entities alien to this world, are all potential predators to a fallen angel. Indeed, there are some who have already discovered this secret and are willing to go to any lengths in order to obtain it."]},"4":{"name":"Dreamers","source":"GHPG","entries":["History repeats itself. Even before the humans had their Eras of Expansion and Descent, other races had built empires on Etharis. The elves and the dwarves both had their time, and other, older races did as well. Where the dwarves of Stehlenwald live today was once the seat of an ancient empire that surpassed any that have come since. The name of this empire has been lost, and only fragmented remains of the oldest stories even hint at the grand heights that race once reached.","What can be gleaned from the histories of the elves and dwarves is that at one point a horrible calamity befell the land, wiping clean any trace of this ancient empire. The disaster came suddenly and without warning, and it was believed that nothing survived. Something did.","When the humans rose to power and began threatening the elves and dwarves, the Stehlenwald dwarves were forced to dig deeper into their mountain strongholds in order to withstand the siege. Deep in the dark, even below the adamantine that proved to be their salvation, the dwarves found sealed chambers dating back to before the cataclysm. With the seal broken, an ancient spell was lifted and the chambers' inhabitants began to stir from their millennia-long slumber.","In the days before the calamity wiped out their civilization, a group of these \"dreamers\" foresaw the danger and came up with a plan to survive it. Time passes differently in dreams, and the ancients sought to use that fact to free themselves from the flow of time. Suspended between reality and dreams, sealed deep underground, they could live in a state of perpetual slumber for as long as necessary and outlast the disaster that would wipe out the rest of their kind.","The plan worked, but living for so long within the dream-world had unforeseen consequences. Upon waking, the dreamers found that they could no longer differentiate between dreams and memories, with both fading quickly from their minds. The result was the emergence of a new race with no knowledge of their own history, only halfformed images and dream-like impressions of a place and time that may or may not have existed.","Now the dreamers struggle to adapt in a world that seems like a waking nightmare. Whatever their history, they have proven to be quick-witted and strong, able to learn new tasks and execute them well.

In recent memory, none have come closer to that dubious honor than the lost city of Ulmyr's Gate. Founded by a group of ambitious wizards who chafed under the limitations imposed upon them by government bureaucracy, Ulmyr's Gate boasted free study for all mages who sought sanctuary within its walls. The Great College quickly became a lodestone for mages of every stripe from across the empire, and for a brief moment there existed a golden age of magic.","That dream came crashing down one night when the founding mages of Ulmyr's Gate attempted a massive conjuration ritual intended to part the veil and create a permanent portal to the Ethereal Plane. It didn't work. Instead their magic caused a massive rift in the very fabric of reality, and in an instant the entire city tipped into the void between worlds. The entire city was presumed dead, the Arcanist Inquisition railed against the hubris of those tampering in things man was not meant to know, and life in the Empire moved on.","Years later, stories surfaced of strange people being sighted in the region where Ulmyr's Gate once stood. These people seemed oddly blurred or indistinct, and some reports said they vanished right in front of witnesses' eyes. Gradually it became clear that these poor souls were the survivors of the Ethereal Rift, now trapped between worlds and trying to retain their tenuous grasp on the Material Plane."]}},{"0":{"name":"Laneshi","source":"GHPG","page":11,"entries":[]},"1":{"source":"GHPG","name":"Charneault","entries":["The dominant language of the Charneault Kingdom."]},"2":{"source":"GHPG","name":"Castinellan","entries":["The dominant language of the Castinellan Provinces.
