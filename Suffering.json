A kuo-toa's body is topped with a fishlike head, complete with a mouthful of sharp teeth and a pair of bulging, silvery eyes with tiny, black pupils. Their eyes are capable of swiveling independently, which improves their peripheral vision but tends to be unsettling to observe.",
							"A kuo-toa's scales can come in a range of colors, including shades of grey, muted greens, and pale yellows. In some of these creatures, their scale's pigmentation could change with their emotional state, becoming reddish when angered or pale white when terrified, for example. Their scaly skin is covered in a layer of slippery slime, giving them a glistening sheen. They often wear simple clothing, consisting of dirty rags and leather straps, alongside accessories made from bones, shells, or gems."

Once a humble surface race, exile to the Underdark combined with endless conflict with the illithid lead to countless centuries of cruelty, enslavement, and magical domination.  Now almost entirely insane, even independent kuo-toa communities have been permanently driven to new heights of madness from this long association. Gods and priests rise and fall in a never ending cycle of mania deep beneath the waves.",

Herding flocks of giant crustaceans, schools of fish, and other placid oceanic life, karkinos families spend their days gazing into the endless depths and ruminating on the nature of the sea. Some karkinos are poets, whose musings are spread far and wide through underwater society, sung and rewritten as ballads and plays. Others isolate themselves far away from civilization with nothing more than their family or flocks for company. Living lives of quiet contemplation, they meditate on ancient truths only known to the long-lived and mysterious karkinos.",

These karkinos are often those who depart from their families to seek adventure, striking an impressive silhouette among groups of aquatic adventurers.",

Sahuagin who terrorize other races, krakens fouling the waters, and other beasts of the deep are all ancestral enemies of the karkinos, and they require little persuasion to mobilize against such threats.

The most powerful of Karkos were swayed into evil by a malicious kraken, and attempted to harness and control the very currents of the ocean, to bend the sea to their will. In retribution, the spirits of the sea sent a mighty sea titan to swallow up the entirety of Karkos, sweeping the city into the eternal depths, never to be seen again.
