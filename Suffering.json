					"This magic weapon emits a cold mist, and is rimed over with small ice crystals. It has 3 charges, and regains {@dice 1d3} charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend a charge to slam the ground or the surface of a body of water, causing sharp ice spikes to form in a line 60 foot wide and 20 foot wide, which last until the end of your next turn. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. If a creature moves into or within the area, it takes {@damage 2d6} piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels."
